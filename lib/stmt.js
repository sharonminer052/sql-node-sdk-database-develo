/**
 * @classdesc  A class encapsulating a prepared query statement. It includes
 * state that can be sent to a server and executed without re-parsing the
 * query. It includes bind variables which may be set for each successive use
 * of the query.  PreparedStatement object is returned as a result of
 * {@link NoSQLClient#prepare} method.  It can be passed to
 * {@link NoSQLClient#query} method for execution and be reused for multiple
 * queries, potentially with different values of bind variables.
 * @extends {PrepareResult}
 * 
 * @hideconstructor
 * 
 * @example //Using PreparedStatement in async function
 * let client = new NoSQLClient(//.....
 * let prepStmt = await this._client.prepare(
 *     'DECLARE $id INTEGER; $sal DOUBLE;  SELECT id, firstName, lastName ' +
 *     'FROM Emp WHERE id <= $id AND salary <= $sal');
 * ps.set('$id', 1100);
 * ps.set('$sal', 100500);
 * let queryRes = await client.query(prepStmt);

 * see {@link NoSQLClient#query}.  BatchCursor is returned by
 * {@link NoSQLClient#cursor} method.  The query starts executing when
 * {@link BatchCursor#next} method is called for the first time.  The result
 * returned by {@link BatchCursor#next} is of type {@link QueryResult},
 * same as the result of {@link NoSQLClient#query} method and generally
 * contains multiple records returned by one query request.
 * <p>
 * Note that BatchCursor object can only be used to fetch results of one query
 * and cannot be reused for multiple queries.  To execute another query, call
 * {@link NoSQLClient#cursor} again to create new BatchCursor.
